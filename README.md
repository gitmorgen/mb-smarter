_[---> Skip to installation](#installation)_

This project expands the functionality of the <a href="https://portal.mbsmartservices.net/" target="_blank">MB Smart admin portal</a> by adding new features to improve efficiency. It is designed to integrate seamlessly with the website, but to feel like a superimposed layer that is visually distinct.

**Disclaimer:**
This project is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or maintained by the creators of MB Smart. It is an independent initiative developed by people who use the website. Use this software at your own discretion.

### 1. Filter Profiles

Make changes quickly across various filter settings by copying a profile as a string of text (e.g. `///Ka890d...`) from one account, and pasting it into another. You can also combine strings by placing them end-to-end (e.g. `///Ka890d...///Via9th...`).

### 2. Bulk Modify URLs
